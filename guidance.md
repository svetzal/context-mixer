```
**CLI Commands (IMPLEMENTED):**
```bash
cmx ingest --project-id "react-frontend" --project-name "React Frontend App"

- [x] ‚úÖ **Project-aware ingestion** - CLI accepts project identification parameters
- [x] ‚úÖ **Project-scoped knowledge retrieval** - Search and assembly respect project boundaries
- [x] ‚úÖ **Cross-project contamination prevention** - Knowledge from different projects doesn't mix inappropriately
- [x] ‚úÖ ChunkingEngine can detect semantic boundaries in real content
- [x] ‚úÖ KnowledgeQuarantine can isolate and manage conflicting chunks
- [ ] ‚ùå Migration tool can convert existing flat files to CRAFT structure (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
- [x] ‚úÖ All CLI commands support CRAFT and project-aware parameters (core commands completed)
- [x] ‚úÖ Assemble command produces working context for AI assistants with project filtering
- [x] ‚úÖ All new functionality has comprehensive tests (ChunkingEngine and KnowledgeQuarantine fully tested)
- [ ] ‚è≥ Documentation updated with new capabilities including project-aware usage (IN PROGRESS)

## **AFTER PHASE 1 - PHASE 2 PREVIEW:**

Once Phase 1 is complete, Phase 2 focuses on:
- Multi-resolution knowledge storage (summary ‚Üí comprehensive)
- Dynamic context window management
- Query analysis and intent recognition
- Advanced relevance scoring

## **DEVELOPMENT APPROACH:**

1. **Start Small:** Implement ChunkingEngine with basic semantic detection first
2. **Test-Driven:** Write tests for each component before implementation
3. **Incremental:** Each component should work independently
4. **Integration:** Test components together as you build them
5. **Documentation:** Update README and docs as you implement features

## **TECHNICAL NOTES:**

- Use existing domain models (KnowledgeChunk, ChunkMetadata) - they're complete
- Leverage existing vector store infrastructure - it's working well
- Follow the Gateway pattern for I/O operations
- Use pydantic for all new data models
- Co-locate tests with implementation files

**The foundation is solid - now it's time to build the intelligent chunking and conflict management layers that will make Context-Mixer truly powerful.**
