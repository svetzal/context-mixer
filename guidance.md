**Impact:** Cross-project knowledge contamination prevention, complete project context selection
**Implementation:** Project-aware capabilities implemented across the system:
```python
# Enhanced domain models (IMPLEMENTED)
class ProvenanceInfo(BaseModel):
    project_id: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Project identifier")
    project_name: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Human-readable project name")
    project_path: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Root path of the source project")

# Enhanced search capabilities (IMPLEMENTED)
class SearchQuery(BaseModel):
    project_ids: Optional[List[str]] = Field(None, description="Filter by specific projects")
    exclude_projects: Optional[List[str]] = Field(None, description="Exclude specific projects")
```
**CLI Commands (IMPLEMENTED):**
```bash
cmx ingest --project-id "react-frontend" --project-name "React Frontend App"
cmx assemble --project-ids "react-frontend" --exclude-projects "legacy-system"
# Note: projects and context-select commands are planned for future implementation
```

### 1. **ChunkingEngine with Semantic Boundary Detection** ✅ **COMPLETED**
**Status:** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - Full implementation with 988 lines of code
**Impact:** Intelligent concept-based chunking now available with semantic boundary detection
**Completed:** `src/context_mixer/domain/chunking_engine.py` with comprehensive functionality:
```python
class ChunkingEngine:
    def detect_semantic_boundaries(self, content: str) -> List[ChunkBoundary]  ✅
    def chunk_by_concepts(self, content: str) -> List[KnowledgeChunk]  ✅
    def validate_chunk_completeness(self, chunk: KnowledgeChunk) -> bool  ✅
    # Plus many additional methods for hierarchical detection, unit analysis, etc.
```
**Evidence:** Working examples in `src/_examples/` demonstrate the system in action

### 2. **KnowledgeQuarantine System** ✅ **COMPLETED**

## **SUCCESS CRITERIA FOR PHASE 1 COMPLETION:**

- [x] ✅ **Project Context Isolation implemented** - Users can choose which project contexts to include
- [x] ✅ **Project-aware ingestion** - CLI accepts project identification parameters
- [x] ✅ **Project-scoped knowledge retrieval** - Search and assembly respect project boundaries
- [x] ✅ **Cross-project contamination prevention** - Knowledge from different projects doesn't mix inappropriately
- [x] ✅ ChunkingEngine can detect semantic boundaries in real content
- [x] ✅ KnowledgeQuarantine can isolate and manage conflicting chunks
- [ ] ❌ Migration tool can convert existing flat files to CRAFT structure (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
- [x] ✅ All CLI commands support CRAFT and project-aware parameters (core commands completed)
- [x] ✅ Assemble command produces working context for AI assistants with project filtering
- [x] ✅ All new functionality has comprehensive tests (ChunkingEngine and KnowledgeQuarantine fully tested)
- [ ] ⏳ Documentation updated with new capabilities including project-aware usage (IN PROGRESS)

## **AFTER PHASE 1 - PHASE 2 PREVIEW:**

Once Phase 1 is complete, Phase 2 focuses on:
- Multi-resolution knowledge storage (summary → comprehensive)
- Dynamic context window management
- Query analysis and intent recognition
- Advanced relevance scoring

## **DEVELOPMENT APPROACH:**

1. **Start Small:** Implement ChunkingEngine with basic semantic detection first
2. **Test-Driven:** Write tests for each component before implementation
3. **Incremental:** Each component should work independently
4. **Integration:** Test components together as you build them
5. **Documentation:** Update README and docs as you implement features

## **TECHNICAL NOTES:**

- Use existing domain models (KnowledgeChunk, ChunkMetadata) - they're complete
- Leverage existing vector store infrastructure - it's working well
- Follow the Gateway pattern for I/O operations
- Use pydantic for all new data models
- Co-locate tests with implementation files

**The foundation is solid - now it's time to build the intelligent chunking and conflict management layers that will make Context-Mixer truly powerful.**
