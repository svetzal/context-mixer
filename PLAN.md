## Phase 1: Performance & Quality Enhancements (Months 1-2)

### 1.1 HDBSCAN Clustering for Conflict Detection Optimization
**Priority**: Critical - Performance Impact  
**Story Points**: 21

**Problem Statement**:
Current conflict detection performs expensive pairwise comparisons between chunks, resulting in hundreds of thousands of LLM calls during ingestion (e.g., 535,095 internal conflict checks reported). This creates a significant performance bottleneck that makes large-scale knowledge ingestion impractical.

**Implementation**:
- Integrate HDBSCAN clustering algorithm to group semantically similar chunks
- Pre-cluster existing knowledge chunks in embedding space using hierarchical density-based clustering
- Implement cluster-aware conflict detection that only checks conflicts within same/nearby clusters
- Use cluster representatives for initial conflict filtering before expensive LLM-based detection
- Maintain cluster stability as knowledge base grows to avoid frequent re-clustering
- Add cluster metadata to chunk storage for efficient cluster-based retrieval

**Technical Approach**:
- Add `hdbscan` dependency to project requirements
- Extend VectorKnowledgeStore with clustering capabilities
- Implement cluster-based conflict detection strategy
- Create cluster maintenance operations for incremental updates
- Add cluster visualization and analytics for monitoring cluster quality
- **API Reference**: Complete HDBSCAN API documentation available in `refs/hdbscan.md`

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] HDBSCAN clustering integration with configurable parameters (min_cluster_size, min_samples)

**Expected Impact**:
- Reduce conflict detection time from O(n*m) to O(k*log(k)) where k << n*m
