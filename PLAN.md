# PLAN.md: Aligning Context-Mixer with CRAFT Theory

## Executive Summary

This plan transforms Context-Mixer from a basic prompt fragment manager into a sophisticated knowledge management system based on the CRAFT theory (Chunk, Resist, Adapt, Fit, Transcend). The roadmap progresses through four major phases, culminating in Model Context Protocol (MCP) resource server capabilities for just-in-time agent context delivery.

**Key Goals:**
- Apply CRAFT principles to create a robust knowledge curation and assembly system
- Evolve from simple prompt mixing to intelligent knowledge orchestration
- Support both ahead-of-time (CLI) and just-in-time (MCP) context delivery
- Maintain backward compatibility while introducing advanced knowledge management features

---

## Current State Analysis

**Existing Strengths:**
- CLI foundation with Typer and rich output
- Git-based storage for version control and collaboration
- LLM integration through mojentic library
- Basic ingest and slice functionality
- Domain models for conflicts and commit messages
- Gateway pattern for I/O isolation

**CRAFT Alignment Gaps:**
- **Chunking**: Simple file-based fragments, no semantic boundary detection
- **Resistance**: Basic conflict detection, no authority hierarchies or temporal versioning
- **Adaptation**: No granularity selection or context-aware detail levels
- **Fitting**: No task-type routing or domain filtering beyond simple tags
- **Transcendence**: Storage-dependent, no knowledge synthesis across domains

**Technical Debt:**
- ~~Inconsistent naming (prompt-mixer vs context-mixer)~~ (RESOLVED)
- Simple flat-file taxonomy without rich metadata
- No vector embeddings or semantic search
- Limited knowledge relationships and dependencies
- No MCP integration for agent-facing APIs

## Conclusion

This plan transforms Context-Mixer from a simple prompt fragment manager into a sophisticated knowledge management system that embodies the CRAFT theory principles. The phased approach ensures steady progress while maintaining backward compatibility and user adoption.

The ultimate vision is a system that not only helps developers manage prompt instructions but fundamentally changes how knowledge is organized, shared, and delivered to AI agents. By implementing CRAFT principles, Context-Mixer will become an essential tool for any organization serious about AI-assisted development and knowledge management.

The progression from CLI-based ahead-of-time context preparation to MCP-based just-in-time agent integration represents a natural evolution that serves both current needs and future AI development patterns. The system will grow with the ecosystem while maintaining its core mission: delivering the right knowledge at the right time in the right format for optimal decision-making.
