## Phase 1: Performance & Quality Enhancements (Months 1-2)

### 1.1 HDBSCAN Clustering for Conflict Detection Optimization
**Priority**: Critical - Performance Impact  
**Story Points**: 34

**Problem Statement**:
Current conflict detection performs expensive pairwise comparisons between chunks, resulting in hundreds of thousands of LLM calls during ingestion (e.g., 535,095 internal conflict checks reported). Additionally, analysis of failed implementations revealed that rigid domain enumeration creates false positives where context-specific rules conflict with general guidelines that apply to different scopes (e.g., "Gateways should not be tested" vs "Write tests for any new functionality").

**Background - Universal Knowledge Hierarchies**:
All knowledge domains exhibit natural hierarchical structures with increasing specificity and contextual bounding:
- **Business Domain**: Corporate policies â†’ Department guidelines â†’ Team practices â†’ Individual procedures
- **Legal/Compliance Domain**: Regulatory frameworks â†’ Industry standards â†’ Company policies â†’ Operational controls
- **Technical Domain**: Architecture patterns â†’ Service types â†’ Implementation details â†’ Code specifics  
- **Operational Domain**: Process frameworks â†’ Workflow categories â†’ Task sequences â†’ Action steps

At each hierarchical level, rules that appear conflicting at a high level are often complementary when understood within their specific contextual boundaries. The clustering system must understand these natural knowledge hierarchies to prevent false positive conflicts between rules that apply to different contextual scopes.

**Enhanced Implementation Strategy**:
Drawing from lessons learned from `copilot/fix-1` and `junie` branch implementations:

**1. Hierarchical Domain-Aware Clustering Architecture**
- Implement nested cluster hierarchy: **Knowledge Domains** â†’ **Contextual Sub-domains** â†’ **Semantic Clusters** â†’ **Knowledge Chunks**
- Use HDBSCAN to automatically discover semantic clusters within all knowledge contexts (business, technical, operational, legal, etc.)
- **Hierarchical Awareness**: Each knowledge chunk maintains awareness of at least one level up in its hierarchy, enabling contextual boundary recognition
- **Cluster Intelligence**: Each cluster maintains awareness of its contained chunks plus a concise summary of the knowledge expressed across those chunks
- Enable context-aware conflict detection that understands domain scope and contextual boundaries to prevent false positives
- Auto-detect domain-specific patterns and contexts from content embeddings across all knowledge types

**2. Dynamic Conflict Detection Strategy** (from junie branch insights)
- Replace rigid domain enumeration with cluster-based dynamic candidate selection
- Implement graduated similarity thresholds based on cluster relationships:
  - Same semantic cluster: 0.7 (high semantic similarity expected)
  - Cross-cluster, same architectural domain: 0.8 (moderate restriction)
  - Cross-domain contexts: 0.9 (high restriction, rare valid conflicts)
- Use cluster representatives and centroids for efficient initial filtering

**3. Robust Configuration Management** (from copilot/fix-1 insights)
- Comprehensive HDBSCAN configuration with validation
- Production-ready error handling and fallback strategies
- Cluster stability maintenance as knowledge base grows
- Configurable clustering parameters per knowledge domain and contextual scope

**4. Git Integration & CI/CD Pipeline**
- Integrate pre-commit hook with HDBSCAN validation
- GitHub Actions workflow setup for Copilot integration
- Automated conflict detection benchmarking in CI

**Technical Implementation**:
```python
