    Guidelines for commit messages:
    - Short message: 50 characters or less, imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature", "Fix bug",
      "Update docs")
    - Long message: Explain what and why, not how. Be concise but informative.
    - Focus on the most significant changes
    - Use present tense, imperative mood
    - Don't include file names unless they're the primary focus
    
    Analyze the provided diff and generate appropriate commit messages.
